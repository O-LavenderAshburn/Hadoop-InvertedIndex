<h1>Hadoop Inverted index</h1>

A typical Inverted Index is an index data structure storing a mapping from content, such as words or numbers, to a set of documents.<br>
 instead of listing references to documents for each word like a typical inverted index does [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index), the program will output<br>

- each word and the total occurrences of the word in the whole dataset,
- one or more lines (all indented by one tab) that show a document ID and the occurrences of the word in that document,
- one or more lines (all indented by one tab) that show sequences of sentences and the position of the word in a sentence. For example, the position
- of the word "What" and "reform?" in the sentence "What might be the effects of this reform?" are 0 and 7 respectively.
